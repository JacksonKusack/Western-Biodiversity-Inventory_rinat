# Western Biodiversity Inventory (rinat)

Scripts to explore and summarize observations from the Western Biodiversity Inventory. For a description of the project see this [webpage](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/community/biodiversity-inventory.html) or the [project](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/biodiversity-inventory-at-western) on iNaturalist.

Here I mainly use functions from the *rinat* package (with some modifications to allow for more API query functionality) and the *iNatTools* package (again with some fixes). 

## Summaries

1. Observer effort

2. Most recently added species

3. 'Rare' species - globally

4. Target species (for me)

5. 'Rare' species - Ontario and middlesex county

6. First firsts for Middlesex
